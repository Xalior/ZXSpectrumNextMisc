Some common ways how to test:

# real board testing:

No argument, space only, empty quotes => should display usage hint

Loading non-NEX file should end with "Not a NEX file (short/bad data)" (NEX file must
have at least 512 bytes (full header), which starts with four bytes "Next")

There are two files "loaderVersion.nex" and "coreVersion.nex" to test the versions checks.

There are two files "empty.nex" and "preserveNextRegs.nex" which should just return to OS,
the "empty" one will reset all Next registers and do "CLS" with magenta border+paper, the
"preserve" should keep 90% of machine state intact (both have "start delay" defined to ~2s).

Trying to load non-existent file (should produce "ESXDOS" error (M_GETERR service))

Loading the tm*** files from this repository to test non-Layer2 screen loading

Testing with regular NEX files whether it actually works :)

Testing the empty files with different 128k memory bank (both should restore 128k bank
according to SYSVAR)

# CSpect: main code and common code paths

- uncomment TESTING define, put CSPECT_BREAK into code of interest, put desired "filename"
to one of testFakeName defines at the very end of source code, and make the TESTING loader
use it, compile to get SNA file, load that into cspect (with -brk option)

# ZEsarUX: proper dot command emulation

- one can build new MMC image with the NEXLOAD2 binary to have the dot command available
(no instructions, because I still don't know any simple way to do this under linux w/o
learning how to use another new tool(s))

- the TESTING variants should work also in ZEsarUX, but avoid CSPECT_BREAK instruction
